Server scripted by GR8

I will no longer be making my scripts public on exilemod forums, due to lack of support from the moderators and developers. I am not welcomed there to post my hard work to public, several of my posts deleted and no respose when i asked why. My work was falgged as stolen when it never was.Furthermore, Exilemod developers are too stuburn to change thier mind about anything, they do not welcome any suggestions, laugh at people trying to tell them whats wrong with the exilemod code, and lastly, do not like it when others contribute and make them look less knowledgeable. No matter how much you donate or contribute to the forums, only people they will value is what gets them more players (big communities and youtubers/streamers.)
